# Tyche protocol

TYCHE protocol is a WEB3 project that is designed to launch multiple decentralized applications (dApps) on different blockchain networks. The project is focused on providing a platform that is both secure and reliable, with a particular emphasis on developing innovative features that can benefit users in multiple ways. The project will start by launching an automated market maker (AMM) on Evmos EVM, and it plans to expand its offerings with other dApps in the future, on different networks.\


One of the most innovative features of the TYCHE protocol is its NFT lending platform. This platform is designed to allow users to borrow instantly by using their NFTs as collateral. This is an entirely new concept that is poised to transform the lending industry, providing new opportunities for individuals to access funding when they need it the most.

The TYCHE protocol team has been working tirelessly to ensure that the platform is not only easy to use but also offers a high level of security. With a user-friendly interface and advanced security features, the TYCHE protocol platform aims to provide a safe and secure environment for users to conduct transactions. With its focus on developing innovative features that can benefit users in multiple ways, the project is well-positioned to make a significant impact on the blockchain industry.
