# Risks of AMM

> It's important to note that impermanent loss is a normal part of providing liquidity in AMM pools and can be mitigated by carefully considering the tokens and market conditions before providing liquidity.

#### Price impact

Price impact is the effect of the user's trade over the market price of an underlying asset pair. It is in direct correlation with the amount of liquidity in the pool. It can be simply measured by the percentage volume of the userâ€™s trade with the base reference of total underlying liquidity in the pool price impact can be especially high for illiquid markets/pairs, and may cause a trader to lose a significant portion of their funds.&#x20;

#### Impermanent loss

is a phenomenon that can occur in decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms that use Automated Market Maker (AMM) algorithms. It refers to the loss in value that liquidity providers experience when the price of the tokens in a liquidity pool changes.

**IL example**

For example, let's say Alice has deposited equal amounts of Ether and USDC into a liquidity pool to provide liquidity. The initial value of the pool is $100,000 with $50,000 in Ether and $50,000 in USDC.

A few days later, the price of ETEHR increased relative to USDC. As a result, the value of the pool increases to $120,000, with $60,000 in EVM and $60,000 in USDC. However, Alice's share of the pool is still worth $50,000. This means that she has experienced an impermanent loss of $10,000, despite the overall value of the pool increasing.

In this scenario, Alice's impermanent loss was caused by the change in the price of the tokens in the pool. As the price of ETH increased relative to USDC, the relative weight of ETH in the pool increased, causing Alice's share of the pool to decrease in value.
