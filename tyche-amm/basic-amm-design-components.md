# BASIC AMM Design Components

#### Liquidity Pool: The Heart of Tyche AMM

The Tyche Protocol operates on a liquidity pool, which is a collection of assets provided by users who want to participate in the platform. When a user deposits assets into the liquidity pool, they receive a proportional share of the pool in return. This shared pool of assets is what allows the Tyche Protocol to match buyers and sellers and determine the price of assets based on supply and demand.

#### Constant Product Formula: Setting Asset Prices Automatically

The constant product formula is a mathematical equation used by the Tyche Protocol to determine the price of assets. This formula takes into account the total value of the liquidity pool and the relative amounts of the different assets in the pool. By using this formula, the Tyche Protocol is able to automatically set the price of assets based on market conditions, providing a fair and reflective market for all users.

#### Token Weighting: Balancing the Market

Token weighting is a process used by the Tyche Protocol to determine the relative importance of different assets in the liquidity pool. By weighing the assets, the platform is able to calculate the price of assets in a balanced manner that accurately reflects market conditions.

#### Trade Execution: Efficient and Intermediary-Free

The Tyche Protocol offers fast and efficient trade execution, allowing users to trade assets without the need for intermediaries. When a user wants to trade an asset, the Tyche Protocol automatically matches them with a buyer or seller and executes the trade. This reduces the time and costs associated with traditional exchanges, making DeFi more accessible to everyone.
